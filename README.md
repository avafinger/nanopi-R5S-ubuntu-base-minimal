# NanoPi R5S Ubuntu minimal image

This is the Ubuntu minimal image with kernel 5.10.110 with CLI (Command Line Interface, no Desktop) for development purposes.
The OS image is small, unbloated and Lean and Mean, where you can add, remove or change packages as you wish.

**i hope this can be usefull**


## Target audience

You need to setup keyboard, language and everything else with command line, no automation process.
It's for anyone who wants to learn, build and develop packages with the Ubuntu environment. 

- Want to run as multimedia, you have it. 
- Want to run AI applications, you have it. 
- Want to run as mini router (2.5 GBPS), you have it.
- Want to run mainline kernel, you have it.


## Yet Another OS Image?

With the OS Image you can have access to the following features:

* Hardware Acceleration (GPU)
* Hardware Decoder (VPU)
* 2x 2.5 GBPS
* RKNPU for AI (NPU)
* USB camera (v4l2)

## WIP

This is a Work In Progress, things that do not work may be fixed in the future, with no timeline, and no guarantee. Use as is.
